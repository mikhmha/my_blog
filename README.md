The website for the game is live! 

# 17/12/2024

A HUGE *huge* *huge* weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I'm now able to make the game available for public play in US-West and EU-West whenever I want to! I was always dreading the task of public deployment for the game - I figured it would take a few weeks to get all the network and security settings correct, but it only took me 2 days!! I made the US-West game server public for a short period yesterday and connected with 0 issues. And the latency was very good! No issues with lag. The deployment process is very straightforward and I have access to tools for measuring bandwidth and server load. 

OK so when is the game going public? Well now I have some leeway. There are a few game and simulation mechanics I need to tune up for public play. I want to launch the game in a state where theres atleast *some* gameplay loop to get feedback on. So thats what I'm working on. But don't worry! I'm expecting to complete this work and launch the game before the new year! 
Also now that the official game website is up - I'm going to post development updates on there. This blog will mostly be for rambling about my life. I need an outlet for that type of thing. 

I received a new book today! **Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook**. I ordered it on a whim 2 days ago. I figured it will come in handy as I end up delving deeper into server hosting on linux. I've never directly administered a linux server like I'm doing for this project. Up untill now this part has been abstracted for me in the form of managed cloud services. I've used different linux distros on and off for my own personal uses but I never gained a deep understanding of linux from these experiences. I don't like constantly googling what commands to run and why. 
Like with any tech book I buy, I don't plan on reading this entire thing front-to-back. I probably wont even read 20% of it. Its a book I reach for reference when I have a vague idea of what I'm trying to acomplish and I know I'll 100% find the definitive answer in the text.
