# 11/03/2025 ACES HIGH

OK my motivation is starting to peak again. I took it slow for 2 days, now I'm focused on working again! Making good progress on investigating and resolving server crashes + reducing latency. I'm getting a hang of linux server admin. There are some awesome tools you can use to measure perf and latency. Linux is so good. One day I will use it as my daily driver. Today I'm going to test out a new configuration out on the US-WEST server, I think it should significantly reduce latency! So I'm excited to see the results. Afterwards the next focus will be on improving the movement and player feel. I want to make character control feel more responsive, and also give players skills to increase movement speed temporarily, etc. It should add a new dynamic to the gameplay. 

# 07/03/2025 RENEWAL

Last night I made the game servers live for US-WEST and EU-CENTRAL. I haven't promoted the launch anywhere or told anyone IRL outside of some very niche spaces (aka not anywhere gamers typically would be).  Theres been some players so far though very intermittently. Again its not a gamer crowd.

The past few weeks I've been depressed, very much so. I recognize it. Its slowed down progress on the game as I've had very little motivation and lots of brain fog. I felt like I was trapped. When I look back I think the cause was due to feeling so overwhelmed, stressed, and other pressures in my life. Yesterday after making the game live I was in a very strange mood. Its no good seeing people connect to the game and barely playing it before leaving - can't blame em. But I wasn't sad. Which was strange. I thought seeing that sort of thing would break me.

Today I woke up with a very strong sense of purpose. It didn't feel at all like the past few weeks. I woke up and got right to work. I think this soft launch has been a blessing. Its given me a very focused direction that was lacking. There are some key things I know to tackle - improving server performance and stability, better new player experience, updates to combat system. And I feel really good knowing I can roll out these updates live. Its not like theres many active players, and any returning active players can check out the improvements on a daily basis. Plus, now I can directly test everything in an actual production environment!

OK but beyond that. Overall I feel good because now I have a focused plan on how I can turn my life around in general. Whether or not the game takes off. I think that was causing me lots of stress, because I had no longterm goal. I'm motivated. I have a deadline of June 2025. I want to make some significant changes in my life by then. It goes beyond updating the game. I know what to do to get where I want to be. I need to remain postive and strong. But I know it will come. Hopefully I can get out of here by June. Only thing I'm stressed about now is money. I finally got around to doing some budgeting this morning and things are not looking too hot. But eh? I think it can be a good motivator.

I know I'm depressed whenever my weekly daily phone usage shoots up. I looked back at the last few weeks and I was at 4-6 hours a day each week. Whenever I'm not depressed its like <2 hours a week. Good barometer. Lets get it back down!

Promoting the game is on pause for now. It just eats up too much time and I want to tackle the lag and new player experience before any sort of mass of players come in. I will resume the promotion again in late March.
I made the mistake of making the KickStarter live. Whatever. I'm not counting on the game to reach the kickstarter goal. Whatever support I get would ideally come through Patreon for now. 


OK wish me luck! Don't think anyone reads this. But please wish me luck! I will wish you luck too.
