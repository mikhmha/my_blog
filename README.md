I'm back in a writing mood. I want to ramble into the void. I see my writing presence on the internet as transient. Here for a brief moment and then gone~ 
Its the reason why I don't wish to blog on a dedicated website for that sort of thing. You know I don't even read other people's blogs - too boring. Well I usually read 1-2 posts but I don't "follow" anyone. And you need to draw me in with some pictures and diagrams, not just words!
I think people think I read a bunch or whatever, I don't. I read 1 book this year so far - The Brothers Karamazov. Other than that, its mostly snippets of wikipedia articles, random internet comments that espouse lots of wisdom, and...explanations for whatever concept I'm trying to learn, which is just more wikipedia and random internet articles and videos. 

Lots of gold on the internet still if you know what to look for. But don't get too lost in the sauce. And don't fall for personalities. I don't care who or where the info comes from as long as its good. Good is subjective. To me, good = not boring, and bad = boring. boring = anything I don't like....I don't know what I don't like. Maybe I don't like anything. Maybe I like everything. 


These days its best to write mountains of nonsense on the internet. Mask intentions in coded language. words, words, words. I want to poison the data used to train the LLMs. 


What did I want to write about today? I can't remember.  
Its almost 1 year since I started working on my MMO game project. I didn't think I would get this far. If I showed a pic of what the game looks like to past-me, he would not beleive it. Its easy to lose sight of the work you are doing when you see it everyday. But also there is still so much work to do. SO much work. I don't want to think about it. Its better to remain delusional and ignore it than think too deeply about it. But also I can't remain delusional forever because I'm running out of money..hahaha. Still I'm very optimistic. I am trying to get back into the groove. Because my momentum has been good but it got derailed the past few weeks. And its making me distraught. So its time for renewal. No I wasn't procrastinating, it was all part of the plan! RENEWAL. I cast my old self down and emerge again.

OK I'm finally done planning. Now its time to start programming again. Its like that saying, spend time sharpening the axe so you can cut the tree down in one strike. yeah, I sharpen the axe while also being anxious the entire time about not cutting the tree. but why? the tree WILL be cut down. don't worry about it. keep sharpening. But what if you sharpen forever ..never cutting down the tree? what am i even saying.

What did planning involve? It involved slipping into a different headspace and staring at grids for several hours. And then going on long walks as a way to procrastinate. Just look at grids bro. Just think about Euclidean spaces bro. Stare into the abyss long enough and it will stare back. 

ON ANOTHER NOTE. I'm coming up on 6 months of being smoke-free. Its a lie, its not like I had 0 cigarettes in this span of time. BUT, of the handful of times I had one I didn't feel the need to start again. It was like a one-and-done type of thing. I think I'm over it. Smoking is BORING. There I said it. 
BUT now its getting cold again....maybe I'll smoke for the month of December.

Lots of new changes! I've been actually playing the game recently and having fun. :). There is still some on-going work in tuning the AI commander strategy decision process. Its tricky because it involves figuring out the correct weights to apply to certain metrics used for strategy formulation and evaluation. The life cycle of a commander strategy is broken down into 3 phases:  **Formulation -> Execution -> Evaluation**. Are formulation and evaluation the same thing? Hmm...I don't think so. Formulation is done when there is no active strategy t0, evaluation is done when there is an active strategy and consists of calcuing a rolling window of averages. The result of **Evaluation** can have 2 outcomes, current strategy continues to execute, OR, current strategy is abandoned and we go back to formulation. But I'm not sure if there should be a 3rd outcome - current strategy is changed to a new strategy. I need to challenge these ideas further. I am reading about some techniques used by the developers of the game "Days Gone". Never played it myself, but the techniques they use are very much in line with what I'm trying to do. They refer to this accumulation of metrics to calculate a value as calculating a  "confidence value" for a squad. 

On another note, the game will finally be able to playtest in December 2024. I'm very bullish on this announcement! The goal is to wrap up this remaining AI work by October 25th, and then there is some remaining work to do with regards to polishing up the game client. Updating UI elements, making a nice connection screen, updating the loot database with descriptions and item names, maybe some map changes. I'm on vaccation for the month of November. I really don't want to go on vacation, but I bought the ticket months ago and here I am. Why did I agree to it? ....Whatever I think it will end up being fun. And I still plan to do work on vacation, and it will be fun work :), recording videos and capturing screenshots for promotional materials. I think maybe there will be a final map revamp. Recently I started playing Diablo 2: Resurrection and its giving me some good ideas of reference for 2D isometric environment design. And a friend is interested in making music + soundeffects for the game, so I will evaluate how easy it is to integrate audio. If its easy, then it will be included in the play-test build. I think we will punch each other at varying intensities and record it. It will be the "male voice damage sound effect".

The game is getting to a good spot. Really. Now the world game supports persistent factions whom compete for control of territories across the map. You will see squads of knights and goblins patrolling the world, expanding their influence, rallying for invasions, and getting into skirmishes and battles with one another. Its very good. I need to record the trailer. I need to show players taking down a goblin squad and getting good loot, then getting overrun moments later. You DIED. Too bad. How far will you get? I'm issuing the viewer a challenge.

Things are so close close close close but I'm hung up on something. And its cutting into the work. Why...now? Its not related to the game. I'm delusionally hopeful for the game. But I feel so isolated from the world. I always have, but even more so these days. I'm good at wearing masks and being amusing in my antics, but it feels all so fake. Like a performance. And sometimes performing is lots of fun but I would never want to be a performer. Give nothing and take nothing. Enter and then exit through the gift-shop. Transience. There is no shortage of people in my life, I like to think I'm a social and friendly person. But I just don't care. And then I'm confronted with the consequences of not caring. So obviously I do care. What do I care about? Making the game. Its the most fulfilled I've been. But is it all another performance? Will it push me further into isolation? is that bad? what am i SO hung up about? it feels like I can't win no matter what i do. im passing time......doomed to a life of "an eccentric type". I hate the term. I don't see myself that way. but others do.

I really hope I can get some money for the game. Just enough to keep me going for a few more months. I want to add more skills and weapon effects and detailed character customization. The game needs wizards and ranged combat. And there is this whole system of world event notifications I want to add which will make the game feel very alive. Please give me money, but don't, I'm too proud to beg, I don't want your money, go away. If I know you IRL I don't want your money. If you pay rent I don't want your money. If you own a ford focus, I don't want your money. 

What is plan B? There is no plan B. Can I hold down a job? I can, I flip the switch that turns me "normal" and I blend in...but eventually it fails. its not being told what to do..its working for someone I don't respect. if you think i'm a joke then i think you're a joke. bozo on bozo violence. Where is the Shogun? I want to serve the Shogun.

I am so depressed. WHY??? I feel like I'm living in hell. Its not fun being like this. Not at all. I feel like a fake-human, a replicant, a freak. I want to go somewhere far away......
Its possible to cure myself...I do it all the time. Shift focus towards working on the game, go back to doing menial chores throughout the day. But its all cope, nothing changes. 
I won't give up or give into pessimism. But also I resign myself to fading away.

I feel much better today. Much more in control. I think the sadness is passing. Before it used to be bad...a death spiral into negative emotions that would last weeks. But today I feel good. I have things to feel proud about. I've made a lot of progress in my life within the last few years. 

Somedays I really resent the feeling of alienation I constantly feel. But other times I wear it with pride. Lots of people feel alienated..and lots of people feel fake, people you don't even expect to feel this way. What else can you do? Keep on going to find your people..wherever they are. Well its not like something literally to be found. You wont find it and be fixed right away. Its all about the journey. Yeah its stuff like that I learned in the last few years. Can't let life pass you by waiting for some perfect oppurtunity to come by because it never will. Nothing is perfect. And theres always things you can be doing. When I was at my worst some years ago, I focused on waking up every morning to shovel the driveway. A very simple task that ended up bringing me lots of joy. 

Why am I so obsessed with the hanged man? Do I want to hang myself? No. In eastern cultures its a popular way to go out, because its associated with shame. I think I do feel shame. Shame for not being able to conform. I can't conform but I expect others to do so. I don't identify with any subcultures or political movements or religions. Then there are media depictions of groups who live outside the norms, thats what the popular conciousness sees people like me as. But I don't identify with any of those groups either! Gender identity, sexual identity, ethnic identity...I don't care about these things, I've never felt confused about them. And I don't consider myself a geek or a nerd or a gamer or an intellectual or an artist, I only have tangential (and fleeting) interest in these things. Recently people identify along psychological diagnoseses - they are ADHD, or autistic, or neurodivergent. Again, its not how I see myself or people in the world. To be frank (and maybe problematic), I just don't beleive in these terms, especially when the reasearch shows how many of these things are on a spectrum and/or socially defined. SO I feel like I can't win and I'm boxed in by others expectations of me. I want to be the most special snowflake. I want to define my own group. Who wants to join my cult? The only rule is that the leader must be exiled or killed every 10 years. Because 10 years of having that much power will surely go to their head and they will have lost the plot. 

I think I'm going to take up swimming as a hobby. I've been meaning to do so for the past 2 years. Maybe now is the time. When I get back from vacation. I want to challenge myself and improve my cardio. 


OK ENOUGH about that. I feel much better today. I am bowing at 90 degrees towards the monitor like a Japanese businessman. I'm bowing to you! Whoever reads this. I promise the game is coming out! Pray for me, however you like, but don't pity me.
