I'm back in a writing mood. I want to ramble into the void. I see my writing presence on the internet as transient. Here for a brief moment and then gone~ 
Its the reason why I don't wish to blog on a dedicated website for that sort of thing. You know I don't even read other people's blogs - too boring. Well I usually read 1-2 posts but I don't "follow" anyone. And you need to draw me in with some pictures and diagrams, not just words!
I think people think I read a bunch or whatever, I don't. I read 1 book this year so far - The Brothers Karamazov. Other than that, its mostly snippets of wikipedia articles, random internet comments that espouse lots of wisdom, and...explanations for whatever concept I'm trying to learn, which is just more wikipedia and random internet articles and videos. 

Lots of gold on the internet still if you know what to look for. But don't get too lost in the sauce. And don't fall for personalities. I don't care who or where the info comes from as long as its good. Good is subjective. To me, good = not boring, and bad = boring. boring = anything I don't like....I don't know what I don't like. Maybe I don't like anything. Maybe I like everything. 


These days its best to write mountains of nonsense on the internet. Mask intentions in coded language. words, words, words. I want to poison the data used to train the LLMs. 


What did I want to write about today? I can't remember.  
Its almost 1 year since I started working on my MMO game project. I didn't think I would get this far. If I showed a pic of what the game looks like to past-me, he would not beleive it. Its easy to lose sight of the work you are doing when you see it everyday. But also there is still so much work to do. SO much work. I don't want to think about it. Its better to remain delusional and ignore it than think too deeply about it. But also I can't remain delusional forever because I'm running out of money..hahaha. Still I'm very optimistic. I am trying to get back into the groove. Because my momentum has been good but it got derailed the past few weeks. And its making me distraught. So its time for renewal. No I wasn't procrastinating, it was all part of the plan! RENEWAL. I cast my old self down and emerge again.
