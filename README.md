I'm back in a writing mood. I want to ramble into the void. I see my writing presence on the internet as transient. Here for a brief moment and then gone~ 
Its the reason why I don't wish to blog on a dedicated website for that sort of thing. You know I don't even read other people's blogs - too boring. Well I usually read 1-2 posts but I don't "follow" anyone. And you need to draw me in with some pictures and diagrams, not just words!
I think people think I read a bunch or whatever, I don't. I read 1 book this year so far - The Brothers Karamazov. Other than that, its mostly snippets of wikipedia articles, random internet comments that espouse lots of wisdom, and...explanations for whatever concept I'm trying to learn, which is just more wikipedia and random internet articles and videos. 

Lots of gold on the internet still if you know what to look for. But don't get too lost in the sauce. And don't fall for personalities. I don't care who or where the info comes from as long as its good. Good is subjective. To me, good = not boring, and bad = boring. boring = anything I don't like....I don't know what I don't like. Maybe I don't like anything. Maybe I like everything. 


These days its best to write mountains of nonsense on the internet. Mask intentions in coded language. words, words, words. I want to poison the data used to train the LLMs. 


What did I want to write about today? I can't remember.  
Its almost 1 year since I started working on my MMO game project. I didn't think I would get this far. If I showed a pic of what the game looks like to past-me, he would not beleive it. Its easy to lose sight of the work you are doing when you see it everyday. But also there is still so much work to do. SO much work. I don't want to think about it. Its better to remain delusional and ignore it than think too deeply about it. But also I can't remain delusional forever because I'm running out of money..hahaha. Still I'm very optimistic. I am trying to get back into the groove. Because my momentum has been good but it got derailed the past few weeks. And its making me distraught. So its time for renewal. No I wasn't procrastinating, it was all part of the plan! RENEWAL. I cast my old self down and emerge again.

OK I'm finally done planning. Now its time to start programming again. Its like that saying, spend time sharpening the axe so you can cut the tree down in one strike. yeah, I sharpen the axe while also being anxious the entire time about not cutting the tree. but why? the tree WILL be cut down. don't worry about it. keep sharpening. But what if you sharpen forever ..never cutting down the tree? what am i even saying.

What did planning involve? It involved slipping into a different headspace and staring at grids for several hours. And then going on long walks as a way to procrastinate. Just look at grids bro. Just think about Euclidean spaces bro. Stare into the abyss long enough and it will stare back. 

ON ANOTHER NOTE. I'm coming up on 6 months of being smoke-free. Its a lie, its not like I had 0 cigarettes in this span of time. BUT, of the handful of times I had one I didn't feel the need to start again. It was like a one-and-done type of thing. I think I'm over it. Smoking is BORING. There I said it. 
BUT now its getting cold again....maybe I'll smoke for the month of December.

Lots of new changes! I've been actually playing the game recently and having fun. :). There is still some on-going work in tuning the AI commander strategy decision process. Its tricky because it involves figuring out the correct weights to apply to certain metrics used for strategy formulation and evaluation. The life cycle of a commander strategy is broken down into 3 phases:  **Formulation -> Execution -> Evaluation**. Are formulation and evaluation the same thing? Hmm...I don't think so. Formulation is done when there is no active strategy t0, evaluation is done when there is an active strategy and consists of calcuing a rolling window of averages. The result of **Evaluation** can have 2 outcomes, current strategy continues to execute, OR, current strategy is abandoned and we go back to formulation. But I'm not sure if there should be a 3rd outcome - current strategy is changed to a new strategy. I need to challenge these ideas further. I am reading about some techniques used by the developers of the game "Days Gone". Never played it myself, but the techniques they use are very much in line with what I'm trying to do. They refer to this accumulation of metrics to calculate a value as calculating a  "confidence value" for a squad. 

On another note, the game will finally be able to playtest in December 2024. I'm very bullish on this announcement! The goal is to wrap up this remaining AI work by October 25th, and then there is some remaining work to do with regards to polishing up the game client. Updating UI elements, making a nice connection screen, updating the loot database with descriptions and item names, maybe some map changes. I'm on vaccation for the month of November. I really don't want to go on vacation, but I bought the ticket months ago and here I am. Why did I agree to it? ....Whatever I think it will end up being fun. And I still plan to do work on vacation, and it will be fun work :), recording videos and capturing screenshots for promotional materials. I think maybe there will be a final map revamp. Recently I started playing Diablo 2: Resurrection and its giving me some good ideas of reference for 2D isometric environment design. And a friend is interested in making music + soundeffects for the game, so I will evaluate how easy it is to integrate audio. If its easy, then it will be included in the play-test build. I think we will punch each other at varying intensities and record it. It will be the "male voice damage sound effect".

The game is getting to a good spot. Really. Now the world game supports persistent factions whom compete for control of territories across the map. You will see squads of knights and goblins patrolling the world, expanding their influence, rallying for invasions, and getting into skirmishes and battles with one another. Its very good. I need to record the trailer. I need to show players taking down a goblin squad and getting good loot, then getting overrun moments later. You DIED. Too bad. How far will you get? I'm issuing the viewer a challenge.

Things are so close close close close but I'm hung up on something. And its cutting into the work. Why...now? Its not related to the game. I'm delusionally hopeful for the game. But I feel so isolated from the world. I always have, but even more so these days. I'm good at wearing masks and being amusing in my antics, but it feels all so fake. Like a performance. And sometimes performing is lots of fun but I would never want to be a performer. Give nothing and take nothing. Enter and then exit through the gift-shop. Transience. There is no shortage of people in my life, I like to think I'm a social and friendly person. But I just don't care. And then I'm confronted with the consequences of not caring. So obviously I do care. What do I care about? Making the game. Its the most fulfilled I've been. But is it all another performance? Will it push me further into isolation? is that bad? what am i SO hung up about? it feels like I can't win no matter what i do. im passing time......doomed to a life of "an eccentric type". I hate the term. I don't see myself that way. but others do.

I really hope I can get some money for the game. Just enough to keep me going for a few more months. I want to add more skills and weapon effects and detailed character customization. The game needs wizards and ranged combat. And there is this whole system of world event notifications I want to add which will make the game feel very alive. Please give me money, but don't, I'm too proud to beg, I don't want your money, go away. If I know you IRL I don't want your money. If you pay rent I don't want your money. If you own a ford focus, I don't want your money. 

What is plan B? There is no plan B. Can I hold down a job? I can, I flip the switch that turns me "normal" and I blend in...but eventually it fails. its not being told what to do..its working for someone I don't respect. if you think i'm a joke then i think you're a joke. bozo on bozo violence. Where is the Shogun? I want to serve the Shogun.

I am so depressed. WHY??? I feel like I'm living in hell. Its not fun being like this. Not at all. I feel like a fake-human, a replicant, a freak. I want to go somewhere far away......
Its possible to cure myself...I do it all the time. Shift focus towards working on the game, go back to doing menial chores throughout the day. But its all cope, nothing changes. 
I won't give up or give into pessimism. But also I resign myself to fading away.

I feel much better today. Much more in control. I think the sadness is passing. Before it used to be bad...a death spiral into negative emotions that would last weeks. But today I feel good. I have things to feel proud about. I've made a lot of progress in my life within the last few years.

Why am I so obsessed with the hanged man? Do I want to hang myself? In eastern cultures its a popular way to go out, because its associated with shame. I think I feel shame. About what? I don't feel close to anyone in my life. I don't like intimacy. People in my life want to get close to me and I shut them out. And then they realize I'm cold-hearted. I only realize it much later. Why do I see people as temporary? The fact that I feel ashamed about it means I care. But I go long stretches of not caring and being completely content with my lifestyle. What do I want??

I'm going to take up swimming as a hobby. I've been meaning to do so for the past 2 years. Maybe now is the time. When I get back from vacation. I want to challenge myself and improve my cardio. 
OK ENOUGH about my feelings. I feel much better today. I am bowing at 90 degrees towards the monitor like a Japanese businessman. I'm bowing to you! Whoever reads this. I promise the game is coming out! Pray for me, however you like, but don't pity me.

I went swimming today. I was terrible! But I felt so so alive. I don't know how many laps I swam. For some reason I thought I didn't know how to tread water but I was able to tread water just fine for a minute. I'm definitely missing something though because I'm not very energy efficient, treading water and also swimming laps took a lot out of me. At the end of it I felt like puking! But when I was floating on my back and doing backstroke, it felt like all my troubles were washing away. 

When I get back from vacation I'm going to start swimming 2x a week. I'm motivated now. And maybe I'll try swimming during vacation whenever the oppurtunity comes. The land of many rivers. I wonder what it feels like to be shocked by an eel? Is it like touching 120V with no load hooked up? I remember doing that in university once and it felt so strange. I don't know how to describe it. Its probably best not to know what being shocked by an eel feels like. You can't feel alive when you're dead! lol. 

Today I certified the first legit draft of the game. Its at a point where I could deploy it and gain feedback from players. Theres enough "spectacle" for that. Though lots of things are still rough around the edges. I leave for vacation tommorow and I feel like I have a solid plan for what sort of work I want to get done there. No major server-side additions! I now have enough to build on whats already in place. I think I know how to add combat skills to the game. There is already a skill system in place that supports cooldowns - its how sitting + health regen works. I want to mess around with implementing shaders on weapons. I think I could do some cool particle skill effects like a flaming sword or a charge attack, etc. This sort of work is relaxing, you know what the end goal will look like, and its not this puzzle where you are trying to think about all the potential ways this might break everything else. Also once I figure out how to do this I can plan for the future update that will add wizards. There is already a cast animation in the game, and also a staff! Fireballs. You can cast fireballs. Also maybe aura skills like diablo. Draw a circle around the players feet with shaders. If I don't manage to get this combat skill stuff done, then its no big deal. I shelve it for update 0.01. 




# 14/11/2024

OK OK OK I'm on vacation now. I've been here 2 days now. So far its been good? I'm taking it easy, but to be honest I also wish I could just be working on the game. I'm at such a critical point right now and it sucks to suddenly "pause" things. But sometimes if you take a pause it can be highly beneficial, giving you a 100x return on productivity. I have so much anxiety around losing momentum. Thats the issue. Take a deep breathe and let things pass. The path to enlightenment. 

On the plane I managed to pass a bunch of time just by planning out the combat skills update on pen and paper. It was super useful and hyped me up...I have a clear path to implementing this now. So here is what I came up with. Currently the game has 3 melee "combat jobs" each with different stat gain formulas. The jobs are: Soldier, Rogue, and Berserker. Other than the stat-gain and weapon choice, combat across all 3 jobs is simmilar. But now, each job will start with 2 job-specific combat skills. These skills are tied to the desired playstyle/archtype of the job. The design of the skills was based on how easy it would be to implement, they don't require any new animations or updates to world state representation. Shader effects are optional. 

**Soldier** - Standard sword and shield class. In some ways they are "boring", you'll know how to play them. They wear plate armour and have the highest defence. Attack Speed - Normal. Can equip 2H weapons. Not much else to say. You play this job if you want to be a knight.

Skill 1 - Power Strike, Single-target damage skill (stab)

Skill 2 - Power Slash, Multi-target skill (slash). Cone-based range. 

**Rogue** - The cool and edgy job, for the naruto demographic. They fight using dual weild daggers and have high accuracy + avoidability making up for their low HP.  Attack Speed - Fast, rogues have the fastest attack speed, allowing them to move up in turn priority. 

Skill 1 - Double Stab, single-target damage skill, attacks the enemy 2x in one turn. 

Skill 2 - NPK (nothin' personal kid), the rogue briefly dissapears and then strikes all surrounding enemies in range. On the next turn, the rogue remains invisible and dodges all incoming attacks.

**Berserker** - A job with a ballsy playstyle. I've always been obssessed/fascinated with the idea of faustian bargain. Making deals with the devil. You sacrifice some part of yourself to gain some temporary power. And theres a limit before you've gone too far, usually it ends in death. Its like drugs. lol. This job wears light leather armor. They start off shirtless and their combat skills generate blood on their bodies. 

Skill 1 - Sacrifice, single-target skill. The berserker takes 2-4 pts of dmg and strikes the target with a *chance* for up to 150% damage. 

Skill 2 - Bloodlust, ??? (single or multi-target idk). REQUIRES a combo of 3 sacrifice to cast. The berserker strikes a target with guaranteed %150 damage and regains 3-8 pts of health.

I'm nearing the end of my "vacation". Only a few more days to go. Overall its been pretty good. Can't say I did a whole lot, but I did something atleast. The days went by quick and I was only bored a handful of times. I managed to implement and test the combat skills update in my combat simulator module. So now I need to integrate the changes into prod. That work is underway but I'm going to complete the final part at home. I have so much to do when I get back. I really really really need to release before the end of year. Though to be honest its looking unlikely unless I cut some corners. Ahhh, I have no choice. 

The server host I was planning to use has increased its US prices. Shit sucks. But its still the cheapest I can find. Oh well. 

I'm saying vaccation has been pretty good, but I'm suffering my schizoid dilemma again. Because even here I feel so out of place, and I've been surrounded by family here who are all happy to see me and quite supportive. I've even made friends here who want to stay in contact - I added them on WhatsApp. But I feel nothing and I keep looking for escape routes. WTF is wrong with me??? All my problems are self-inflicted. And then I wonder why no one sticks around. because I don't stick around..duh. Or maybe its because I outlive my use to them once they see the real me. 

When I get back home, its going to be my birthday in a few days. And I don't care. Its gonna be pretty uneventful. Nothing ever changes. 

# 03/12/2024

2 more days to go and then I'm back home. Today I planned out the remaining work I have to do till launch. The plan is realisitic! So realistic in fact that launch is now late December 2024. It will be buggy, I know what corners to cut. I'm not happy about it, but also I am :). It is what it is~ 

About my mental state, its always in flux. Some days I'm lost, other days I come to the true conclusion. You need to own who you are. And today I'm unapologetically myself. Whatever that is. These days everyone is lost. 



# 07/12/2024

Finally, I'm back home. Its good to be back. Was the vacation a net negative or positive? I think thats what I'll spend the next month figuring out. But also I already know the answer, it was a net positive! And even if thats untrue I would NEVER admit it to myself. So theres no need to spend anytime thinking more about this. It would've only been negative if I got seriously ill or injured, but I didnt. The only downside? The game is slightly more delayed - big deal. Well, there is one other (*minor*) downside. I got addicted to cigarettes again. Oh no! I'm not REALLY addicted though. I just do it because I'm a bored young man.
