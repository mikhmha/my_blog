# 02/21/2025 CRASHING OUT

It feels like things are crumbling fast. Today I went swimming. Its been my happy place since starting 2 months ago. But today was different. I couldn't keep my head clear and just breathe. WHATS WRONG WITH ME? I shouldn't let this one thing ruin the day for me. Right? 

If things go well for you - *they* say its because you worked on yourself. When things go bad - *they* say its because you were trying to run away from your problems. Who is *they*? No clue. I could not tell you. Its a hypothetical entity to focus anger on. We are all *they* at some point or another. 


Every person I've reached out to hang out with and just talk or chill IRL in the past few months always tells me they're busy. Then I run into them and they ask me why we never hang out. ???. No one cares. Yeah I get it, everyone is busy these days. But then they say they'll call or text back and then they don't. OK. I am just tolerated in group settings as an eccentric. I hate it here. 

I feel like checking out and leaving. Yeah I could let this period of sadness pass but so what? I don't like being a clown. Thats not what I am. 

I really want to sit by the ocean.

Once again I am down in the dumps. So it means I have to start writing about my feelings again. It started a week ago. Things were going so well up until then. I've been trying to live a healthy and active lifestyle. I haven't missed a single gym day, been going swimming 2x a week, trying to get better at some sports, I lost >7lbs and am looking more lean each day. I go to bed early. Everyday I play piano for an hour before starting work on my game which is also progressing. Oh, and I haven't had any cravings for cigarettes. ZERO. PROGRESS PROGRESS PROGRESS. In all aspects of life! 

So whats wrong? I don't know. A demon has entered my mind again. No its not a demon, its me. I take full responsibility. I really hate living like this. I grow so resentful and indifferent towards the world. I'm indifferent because I'm resentful. And its worse because you know you're doing the *right* things and changing things up but then you still find yourself in the same place. So nothing really changes.....its a harsh truth to face. Of course I know I need to let this pass. Like before. The sadness comes and goes. Good times are on the horizon. But I'm tired.

Working on the game keeps me going. When I started working on this project 14 months ago I didn't know what to expect. Its led to some of the most fufilling days of my life, tackling challenging problems and seeing the results come to life. But they don't tell you how isolating it can all be (actually they do but I ignored it because I'm not like *them* JOKES ON ME). No one knows what you do. I don't know what I do. I would say I spend all day thinking about bullshit and then occasionally acting on it. Bullshit in, bullshit out. Developing games isn't the only *career* like this. But I see why so many solo game devs are nutcases - or end up becomming nutcases. And you do this and put all your focus into it while life passes you by. Then the party ends and you wake up. The place is empty, everyone left a while ago. No one who was there wants anything to do with you when you call them the next day. They had a good time but now they pity you. TOTAL emasculation.

Once again I don't feel close to ANYONE in my life. I still don't know if its by choice or not. Why does it end up this way? No one sticks around. Is it because I don't stick around? I don't stick around because they don't stick around. Chicken or the egg? Where are my people? I keep looking but they are nowhere to be found. When times are good I OWN this feeling in its entierity. But when times are bad I feel crushed by it. I don't like it here.

AHHHHHHH. I'm so close to launching the game. I need to finish. I know what I have to do. So why am I procrastinating? I don't know. Things were going good. Now suddenly I feel worthless. Pessimism is creeping in. The game sucks! Total piece of shit. No one will play it. The gameplay loop needs more content. I need more time, I need more money. I really need to get out of the current situation I'm in. I'm trying really hard to do that but I feel so trapped. I was told to never complain. So I won't. Breathe in. Breathe out. I really want to move somewhere new..... Life is so fun sometimes but theres so much boringness in between. But a life of only fun would become boring eventually. lol. Theres no way to win.

What can I do RIGHT now to help myself? I don't want to jump off a bridge.  I don't know how to explain to where the time goes. Am I just an unemployed man who has gone full delusional? I tried to fly to close to the sun, now i face the consequences. I really wish I could dissapear.

New Year! Unfortunately I wasn't able to launch SWARMMO in time for the end of 2024. But I'm not pressed. I don't think anyone was eagerly waiting for the release date. I'd be dissapointed and demotivated by the delays if it was due to being unable to complete gameplay features/subsystems in time. Thats not the case though, the delays are because the planned features are complete and then I realized I can get lots of mileage out of expanding them. Quick wins and all that. So the game gets delayed a bit, but its because the scope has expanded (to a reasonable level). Unreasonable scope would be things like delaying the game to implement whole new gameplay systems like building or resource collection. Don't worry, I'm not doing that. Is there a new planned release date? All I can say is - very very very very soon. I can make the game available for public play at any time, I want to get things right.
