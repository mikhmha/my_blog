The website for the game is live! 

# 17/12/2024

A HUGE *huge* *huge* weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I'm now able to make the game available for public play in US-West and EU-West whenever I want to! I was always dreading the task of public deployment for the game - I figured it would take a few weeks to get all the network and security settings correct, but it only took me 2 days!! I made the US-West game server public for a short period yesterday and connected with 0 issues. And the latency was very good! No issues with lag. The deployment process is very straightforward and I have access to tools for measuring bandwidth and server load. 

OK so when is the game going public? Well now I have some leeway. There are a few game and simulation mechanics I need to tune up for public play. I want to launch the game in a state where theres atleast *some* gameplay loop to get feedback on. So thats what I'm working on. But don't worry! I'm expecting to complete this work and launch the game before the new year! 
Also now that the official game website is up - I'm going to post development updates on there. This blog will mostly be for rambling about my life. I need an outlet for that type of thing. 

I received a new book today! **Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook**. I ordered it on a whim 2 days ago. I figured it will come in handy as I end up delving deeper into server hosting on linux. I've never directly administered a linux server like I'm doing for this project. Up untill now this part has been abstracted for me in the form of managed cloud services. I've used different linux distros on and off for my own personal uses but I never gained a deep understanding of linux from these experiences. I don't like constantly googling what commands to run and why. 
Like with any tech book I buy, I don't plan on reading this entire thing front-to-back. I probably wont even read 20% of it. Its a book I reach for reference when I have a vague idea of what I'm trying to acomplish and I know I'll 100% find the definitive answer in the text.

New Year! Unfortunately I wasn't able to launch SWARMMO in time for the end of 2024. But I'm not pressed. I don't think anyone was eagerly waiting for the release date. I'd be dissapointed and demotivated by the delays if it was due to being unable to complete gameplay features/subsystems in time. Thats not the case though, the delays are because the planned features are complete and then I realized I can get lots of mileage out of expanding them. Quick wins and all that. So the game gets delayed a bit, but its because the scope has expanded (to a reasonable level). Unreasonable scope would be things like delaying the game to implement whole new gameplay systems like building or resource collection. Don't worry, I'm not doing that. Is there a new planned release date? All I can say is - very very very very soon. I can make the game available for public play at any time, I want to get things right.

AHHHHHHH. I'm so close to launching the game. I need to finish. I know what I have to do. So why am I procrastinating? I don't know. Things were going good. Now suddenly I feel worthless. Pessimism is creeping in. The game sucks! Total piece of shit. No one will play it. The gameplay loop needs more content. I need more time, I need more money. I really need to get out of the current situation I'm in. I'm trying really hard to do that but I feel so trapped. I was told to never complain. So I won't. Breathe in. Breathe out. I really want to move somewhere new..... Life is so fun sometimes but theres so much boringness in between. But a life of only fun would become boring eventually. lol. Theres no way to win.

What can I do RIGHT now to help myself? I don't want to jump off a bridge. It feels like I've burned the good-will of people close to me IRL. Becasue I keep telling them the game is coming soon. And then it doesn't. So now I face frustration from them. I don't know how to explain to them where the time goes. Am I just an unemployed man who has gone full delusional? Is their frustration justified? I tried to fly to close to the sun, now i face the consequences. I really wish I could dissapear.
